As such, developing the skills necessary for incorporating spatial data into reproducible statistical workflows is critical. In this course, we will introduce the core components of manipulating spatial data within the R statistical environment including managing vector and raster data, projections, extraction of data values, interpolation, and plotting. Students will also learn to prototype and benchmark different workflows to aid in applying the appropriate tools to their research questions."

    "text": "Prerequisite Knowledge and Skills\nYou can succeed in this class.\nSome familiarity with the R statistical environment is helpful, but not necessary. My goal is to foster an environment where we are all learning from each other and sharing the tips and tricks that help us along the way. Learning R can be difficult at first—it’s like learning a new language, just like Spanish, French, or Chinese. I find it helpful to remember the following:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later. Even experienced programmers find themselves bashing their heads against seemingly intractable errors. If you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, e-mail me, etc.\n\n— Hadley Wickham\n\n\nIf you want to start learning a few of the basics, the Resources tab has some background information to get you started. Note that this is not an exhaustive list - the number of new R tutorials available on the internet seems to be growing exponentially.\n\nGetting Help With R problems\nI am happy to help you work through your R coding challenges, but there are a lot of you and only one of me. Moreover, I may not always know exactly how to fix your problem any better than you do. In order to make sure that I am not the primary obstacle to your ability to complete the class assignments, I’m asking that you use the following steps prior to emailing/Slacking me with your coding questions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nWhen you send me a question, please let me know what you searched, why the solutions you found don’t work for you, and what output you are expecting**\n\n\nWe’ll spend a bit of time on asking better questions and getting better answers so don’t worry if you aren’t quite sure how this all works.\n\nGoogle it! Searching for help with R on Google can sometimes be tricky. Google is generally smart enough to figure out what you mean when you search for “r reproject polygons”, but if it does struggle, try searching for “rstats” instead (e.g. “rstats reproject polygons”). Also, since most of your R work will deal with the RSpatial packages, it’s often easier to just search for the package name and operation rather than the letter “r” (e.g. “sf reproject polygons”). I often paste the specific error message I get along with the spatial package I’m using to try and help Google find my solutions.\nAsk your colleagues We have an r_spatial chatroom at Slack where anyone in this class can ask questions and anyone can answer. Ask questions about code or class materials. You’ll likely have similar questions as your peers, and you’ll likely be able to answer other peoples’ questions too. As a bonus, Slack allows you to format code to make it easy for all of us to copy and paste your code and distinguish it from the rest of your question.\nUse the forums Two of the most important sources for help with R-coding are StackOverflow (a Q&A site with hundreds of thousands of answers to all sorts of programming questions) and RStudio Community (a forum specifically designed for people using RStudio and the tidyverse (i.e. you)). If you aren’t able to find an answer to your question from the thousands of existing questions, you can post your own. You’ll need to create a reproducible example so others can figure out what you’re trying to do and what error you’re receiving, but you’d be amazed how helpful the community can be.\nAsk me! Sign up for a time to meet with me during student hours at https://calendly.com/carolynkoehn-u. I’ll want to know what searches you’ve tried (so I don’t chase down answers that you’ve already seen) and what approaches you’ve tried and why they haven’t worked. Remember, I’m here to help (but not write your code for you)."

    "text": "Course Materials\n\nR and RStudio\nR is free, but it can sometimes be a pain to install and configure especially when dealing with spatial packages (we’ll talk more about why this is during class). To make life easier, I have set up an online RStudio server service, which lets you run a full instance of RStudio in your web browser. This means you won’t have to install anything on your computer and we should be able to avoid a number of the machine-specific issues that pop-up when 20 students have 20 different computers, operating systems (OS), etc. If you haven’t installed R on your local machine and would like some help getting that set up, there’ a useful set of instructions for installing R, RStudio, and all the tidyverse packages here.\n\n\nGit and Github Classroom\nAll assignments will be managed using GitHub classroom. This will allow each you to have your own repositories for each assignment and make it easier for me to comment on and help with your code. To use this, you should sign up for the GitHub Student Developers Pack as soon as possible and send me your github username. Once I have that, I can add you to the course and make sure that you have access to all of the necessary data and example code.\n\n\nReadings\nThe goal of this course is primarily to get you started with spatial workflows in R. That said, maps (and the spatial data that produce them) are extremely powerful and their use comes with risks and responsibilities. Although most of this course will focus on getting the code right, I’ll mix in a few readings each week to help tie the technical details of our code back to the broader contexts of spatial analysis or to illustrate new applications of the methods you are learning."

    "section": "Assignments and Grades",
    "text": "Assignments and Grades\nI teach this course because I believe that a) we can learn a lot about social and ecological processes by studying where they happen, b) integrating spatial analysis directly into statistical workflows makes those analyses more robust and reproducible, and c) overcoming coding challenges can provide a profound sense of accomplishment. That said, I recognize that there are many reasons that you are taking this course and that my objectives may differ from yours. In order to make sure that you get what you need out of this class, we’ll be using a mix of approaches for determining your grade in this course.\nSelf-assessment (12.5 pts x 2):  During the first week of the course, I’m going to ask you to reflect on what you want out of this course (concepts, skills, practice, etc.). This assessment will help me do a better job of aligning the content of the course to your specific needs. Grading for the self-assessment is described on the assignments page.\nExercises (5pts x 10): There are ten homework assignments. These exercises are designed to reinforce the material we cover in lecture, give you practice designing and implementing your own workflows, and build habits that promote reproducibility in science. They also allow me get a sense for your engagement in the course. Exercises are due at 11:59PM on their due date (generally Thursdays). I will post the “key” within 3 days of the due date and will not accept submissions after the key is posted. If you turn the assignment in on-time with the required number of commits, you’ll receive full credit.\nAssignment Revisions (25pts x 3): We will have three “assignment revisions” due during the course. These provide an opportunity for me to check in and see how things are going. You’ll be able to update your responses to the homeworks based on the keys and reflect on what you’ve learned throughout the course of the assignments. You’ll also be able to provide additional feedback on how the course is going for you. Rather than assign arbitrary points to each assignment, I’m going to grade your assignment revisions using the following ‘levels’ (inspired by Sarah K. Johnson’s description of her graduate data analysis course at Tufts):\n\nPlease Resubmit: This indicates that either your code does not run as written (i.e., your Rmarkdown document will not compile on my computer), you did not use Git as instructed, and/or that your responses to the questions I posed indicate that you do not quite understand the material as well as I would like. You’ll need to schedule an appointment to talk with me and we’ll work out what you need to do to get credit for the assignment. Although there isn’t a hard deadline for this resubmission, the assignments build on each other so it’s in your best interest to complete the resubmission before you get to the next assessment. Failure to resubmit will result in no credit for the assessment.\nResubmit If You Like: This indicates that all of the code works as written and that you used Git, but that you may have missed some important concepts. You’re welcome to resubmit the assignment and address my comments to help polish the final product, but it is not required for you to get credit for the assignment.\nGood To Go: All of your code works, you completed the necessary Git steps, and all of the pieces are there and polished. I may have some minor comments, but I don’t need you to address them for this assignment.\n\nFinal Project (50pts):  The final project asks you to conduct an entire spatial analysis from layout to results. Grades on the final project are based on your objectives and your self-assessment of whether or not you achieved those objectives. Your first draft of the final project will be due December 5. I’ll make comments based on the same categories for the homework revision and you’ll have time to revise your submission prior to the final deadline of December 12.\nYou can find descriptions for all the assignments on the assignments page.\n\nGrades\nWe’ll use a form of contract grading to determine your grades in the course. Contract grading allows us to have a conversation about what you want out of the course, what you expect to put into it, and what I think you need to be successful in deploying the skills we learn here. Based on your goals for course, we’ll sign a contract that instantiates your objectives into the grade you’ll receive for the course. Complete the assignments and meet your objectives and you’ll get the grade you chose.\nThe expectations for the grades are:\n\nA You complete all of the self-assessments and at least 8 of the exercises. All of the assignment revisions achieve the “Good to Go” level. Your final project achieves the “Good to Go” level. My assessment of the various levels will be based on your objectives for the course and your ability to follow instructions.\nB You complete all of the self-assessments and at least 8 of the exercises. At least one of the assignment revisions achieves the “Good to Go” level with the remainder achieving “Resubmit if you like”. Your final project achieves the “Resubmit if you like” level. My assessment of the various levels will be based on your objectives for the course and your ability to follow instructions.\nC You complete all of the self-assessments and at least 6 of the exercises. All of your assignment revisions achieve the “Resubmit if you like” level. Your final project achieves the “Resubmit if you like” level. My assessment of the various levels will be based on your objectives for the course and your ability to follow instructions.\nD You complete all of the self-assessments and at least 4 of the exercises. At least one of your assignment revisions achieves the “Resubmit if you like” level. Your final project achieves the “Resubmit if you like” level. My assessment of the various levels will be based on your objectives for the course and your ability to follow instructions.\n\n\n\nAttendance and incomplete assignments\nAttendance is an important part of this course. You are allowed to miss 2 classes without providing any justification (stuff happens). Beyond that, each additional absence will result in a 0.5 grading reduction (i.e., an A becomes and A-). Similarly, completing the assignments to a satisfactory level is vital to ensure you have a firm grip on the code and concepts. Hence, each assignment that fails to achieve a “Resubmit If You Like” will result in 0.5 grading reduction.\n\n\nLate work\nI would highly recommend staying caught up as much as possible, but if you need to turn something (other than the exercises and final project) in late, that’s fine—there’s no penalty."

You can also explore other packages. Many packages provide access to the ‘spatial’ backbones of R (like geos and gdal), they just differ in how the “verbs” are specified. For sf operations the st_ prefix is typical. For rgeos operations, the g prefix is common."

    "text": "RStudio on your computer\nRStudio.cloud is convenient, but it can be slow and it is not designed to be able to handle larger datasets, more complicated analysis, or fancier graphics. Over the course of the semester, you should wean yourself off of RStudio.cloud and install all these things locally. This is also important if you want to customize fonts, since RStudio.cloud has extremely limited support for fonts other than Helvetica.\nHere’s how you install all these things\n\nInstall R\nFirst you need to install R itself (the engine).\n\nGo to the CRAN (Collective R Archive Network)1 website: https://cran.r-project.org/\nClick on “Download R for XXX”, where XXX is either Mac or Windows:\n\nIf you use macOS, scroll down to the first .pkg file in the list of files (in this picture, it’s R-4.0.0.pkg; as of right now, the current version is 4.2.1) and download it.\nIf you use Windows, click “base” (or click on the bolded “install R for the first time” link) and download it.\n\nDouble click on the downloaded file (check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\nIf you use macOS, download and install XQuartz. You do not need to do this on Windows.\n\n\n\nInstall RStudio\nNext, you need to install RStudio, the nicer graphical user interface (GUI) for R (the dashboard). Once R and RStudio are both installed, you can ignore R and only use RStudio. RStudio will use R automatically and you won’t ever have to interact with it directly.\n\nGo to the free download location on RStudio’s website: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download\nThe website should automatically detect your operating system (macOS or Windows) and show a big download button for it:\nIf not, scroll down a little to the large table and choose the version of RStudio that matches your operating system.\nDouble click on the downloaded file (again, check your Downloads folder). Click yes through all the prompts to install like any other program.\n\nDouble click on RStudio to run it (check your applications folder or start menu).\n\n\nInstall tidyverse\nThe tidyverse consists of dozens of packages (including ggplot2) that all work together. Rather than install each individually, you can install a single magical package and get them all at the same time.\nYou can install packages manually in RStudio, but this can be a bit fragile, especially for some of the spatial packages. Instead of using the RStudio GUI we’ll just install thins at the prompt. To install the tidyverse pacakge (and all of its associated dependencies) run the following: install.packages(\"tidyverse\").",

For example, a single point will be a POINT, several points will be a MULTIPOINT, and an object containing points, polygons, and lines will be a GEOMETRYCOLLECTION. We need to be aware of what types of geometries and objects we have becasue some operations are restricted to particular types of objects or geometries as indicated by errors that read:\nError in UseMethod(\"st_crs&lt;-\") :    no applicable method for 'st_crs&lt;-' applied to an object of class \"c('XY', 'POINT', 'sfg')\"\nwhich indicates that the function (st_crs) does not have a method defined for the type of object it’s being applied to. Note that the function inside UseMethod will be replaced by whichever function you’re attempting to apply to your object and the object of class component will vary based on the function and the object class.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\ntype\ndescription\n\n\n\n\nPOINT\nsingle point geometry\n\n\nMULTIPOINT\nset of points\n\n\nLINESTRING\nsingle linestring (two or more points connected by straight lines)\n\n\nMULTILINESTRING\nset of linestrings\n\n\nPOLYGON\nexterior ring with zero or more inner rings, denoting holes\n\n\nMULTIPOLYGON\nset of polygons\n\n\nGEOMETRYCOLLECTION\nset of the geometries above\n\n\n\nAs is, these geometries are built on vertices with coordinates that are based on the Cartesian plane and thus are “spatial”, but not georeferenced or geographic.

    "text": "Conventions in sf and the tidyverse\nOne of the benefits of the sf package is that it is designed to interface with the tidyverse suite of packages. One of the appealing parts of working with tidyverse packages is that they share an underlying philosophy, data structure, and grammar. This can make life a lot easier as you move from getting your data into R, constructing a set of covariates (including those derived from spatial data), analyzing, and plotting (or mapping) those data. People have strong opinions about the tidyverse, but I find it to be an (eventually) useful way for people to gain some intuition for working in R. One of the grammatical conventions used in the tidyverse suite of packages is the use _ in function calls (this is known as snake case should you ever need to know that at a dinner party). The _ is typically used to separate the verb in a function call from its predicate. For example, bind_rows() in the dplyr package “binds” (the verb) rows (the predicate) wheras bind_cols() binds columns. For the sf package it’s slightly different in that most of the functions begin with a st_ or sf_ prefix to indicate that the function is designed to work on spatial objects followed by a word (or words) describing what the operation does (e.g., st_centroid() returns a MULTIPOINT object with each point located at the centroid of a polygon). We can classify these functions based on what they are expected to return:\n\nPredicates: evaluate a logical statement asserting that a property is TRUE\nMeasures: return a numeric value with units based on the units of the CRS\nTransformations: create new geometries based on input geometries.\n\nWe can also distinguish these functions based on how many geometries that operate on:\n\nUnary: operate on a single geometry at a time (meaning that if you have a MULTI* object the function works on each geometry individually)\nBinary: operate on pairs of geometries\nn-ary: operate on sets of geometries\n\nWe’ll focus on the unary operators for now, but the binary and n-ary operators will become more important as we move to develop databases for spatial analysis.\n\nUnary predicates\nUnary predicates are helpful ‘checks’ to make sure the object you are working with has the properties you might expect. Are the geometries valid? Is the data projected? Because we are asking a set of TRUE/FALSE questions, these functions are specified as st_is_:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\npredicate\nasks…\n\n\n\n\nsimple\nis the geometry self-intersecting (i.e., simple)?\n\n\nvalid\nis the geometry valid?\n\n\nempty\nis the geometry column of an object empty?\n\n\nlonglat\ndoes the object have geographic coordinates?

    "text": "Okay, now that we have all of those details out of the way, let’s take a look at data structures in R. As we discussed,R has six basic types of data: numeric, integer, logical, complex, character, and raw. For this class, we won’t bother with complex or raw as you are unlikely to encounter them in your introductory spatial explorations.\n\nNumeric data are numbers that contain a decimal. They can also be whole numbers\nIntegers are whole numbers (those numbers without a decimal point).\nLogical data take on the value of either TRUE or FALSE. There’s also another special type of logical called NA to represent missing values.\nCharacter data represent string values. You can think of character strings as something like a word (or multiple words). A special type of character string is a factor, which is a string but with additional attributes (like levels or an order). Factors become important in the analyses and visualizations we’ll attempt later in the course.\n\nThere are a variety of ways to learn more about the structure of different data types:\n\nclass() - returns the type of object (high level)\ntypeof() - returns the type of object (low level)\nlength() tells you about the length of an object\nattributes() - does the object have any metadata\n\n\n\nCode\nnum &lt;- 2.2\nclass(num)\n\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nCode\ntypeof(num)\n\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nCode\ny &lt;- 1:10 \ny\n\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nCode\nclass(y)\n\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nCode\ntypeof(y)\n\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nCode\nlength(y)\n\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nCode\nb &lt;- \"3\"\nclass(b)\n\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nCode\nis.numeric(b)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nCode\nc &lt;- as.numeric(b)\nclass(c)\n\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can store information in a variety of ways in R.

They are not a separate type of object but simply an atomic vector with dimensions; the number of rows and columns. As with atomic vectors, the elements of a matrix must be of the same data. Matrices are the foundation of rasters, which we’ll be discussing frequently throughout the course\n\n\n\nCode\n#matrices are filled columnwise in R\nm &lt;- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)\ndim(m)\n\n\n[1] 2 3\n\n\nCode\nx &lt;- 1:3\ny &lt;- 10:12\n\na &lt;- cbind(x, y)\ndim(a)\n\n\n[1] 3 2\n\n\nCode\na[3,1]\n\n\nx \n3 \n\n\nCode\nb &lt;- rbind(x, y)\ndim(b)\n\n\n[1] 2 3\n\n\nCode\nb[1,3]\n\n\nx \n3 \n\n\n\nLists: Lists essentially act like containers in R - they can hold a variety of different data types and structures including more lists.

    "text": "Okay, now that we have all of those details out of the way, let’s take a look at data structures in R. As we discussed,R has six basic types of data: numeric, integer, logical, complex, character, and raw. For this class, we won’t bother with complex or raw as you are unlikely to encounter them in your introductory spatial explorations.\n\nNumeric data are numbers that contain a decimal. They can also be whole numbers\nIntegers are whole numbers (those numbers without a decimal point).\nLogical data take on the value of either TRUE or FALSE. There’s also another special type of logical called NA to represent missing values.\nCharacter data represent string values. You can think of character strings as something like a word (or multiple words). A special type of character string is a factor, which is a string but with additional attributes (like levels or an order). Factors become important in the analyses and visualizations we’ll attempt later in the course.\n\nThere are a variety of ways to learn more about the structure of different data types:\n\nclass() - returns the type of object (high level)\ntypeof() - returns the type of object (low level)\nlength() tells you about the length of an object\nattributes() - does the object have any metadata\n\n\n\nCode\nnum &lt;- 2.2\nclass(num)\n\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\nCode\ntypeof(num)\n\n\n[1] \"double\"\n\n\nCode\ny &lt;- 1:10 \ny\n\n\n [1]  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10\n\n\nCode\nclass(y)\n\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nCode\ntypeof(y)\n\n\n[1] \"integer\"\n\n\nCode\nlength(y)\n\n\n[1] 10\n\n\nCode\nb &lt;- \"3\"\nclass(b)\n\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nCode\nis.numeric(b)\n\n\n[1] FALSE\n\n\nCode\nc &lt;- as.numeric(b)\nclass(c)\n\n\n[1] \"numeric\"\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can store information in a variety of ways in R.

They are not a separate type of object but simply an atomic vector with dimensions; the number of rows and columns. As with atomic vectors, the elements of a matrix must be of the same data. Matrices are the foundation of rasters, which we’ll be discussing frequently throughout the course\n\n\n\nCode\n#matrices are filled columnwise in R\nm &lt;- matrix(1:6, nrow = 2, ncol = 3)\ndim(m)\n\n\n[1] 2 3\n\n\nCode\nx &lt;- 1:3\ny &lt;- 10:12\n\na &lt;- cbind(x, y)\ndim(a)\n\n\n[1] 3 2\n\n\nCode\na[3,1]\n\n\nx \n3 \n\n\nCode\nb &lt;- rbind(x, y)\ndim(b)\n\n\n[1] 2 3\n\n\nCode\nb[1,3]\n\n\nx \n3 \n\n\n\nLists: Lists essentially act like containers in R - they can hold a variety of different data types and structures including more lists. We use lists a lot for functional programming in R where we can apply a function to each element in a list. We’ll see this with extracting values from multiple rasters.

    "text": "Quarto\nThis is a Quarto document (in fact, this whole webpage and all of the slides were built with Quarto). Quarto uses the knitr package to render files containing R, python, and julia to Markdown as a means of rendering code, text, math, figures, and tables to a variety of formats.\n\nMarkdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML documents (it’s the basis for the Readme docs that GitHub creates for you). From there, RStudio calls pandoc to render the markdown file into your chosen output format. I’m telling you this because there will be times when some part of this pipeline may break and you’ll need to know where the errors might be coming from.\nYou can create new Quarto documents by going to File &gt;&gt; New File &gt;&gt; New Quarto Document (or Presentation). There are lots of new documents devoted to Quarto, but some of them may assume you have some familiarity with Markdown or Rmarkdown. As such, I’m keeping this links to helpful Rmarkdown resources like this cheatsheet and a much longer user’s guide in case you need more in-depth discussion of some of the ideas behind authoring in Quarto. I don’t expect you to become an expert in Quarto, but it is a helpful way to keep all of your thoughts and code together in a single, coherent document. Getting proficient in Quarto and git allows you to work with collaborators on an analysis, graphics, and manuscript all within a single platform. This fully-integrated workflow takes practice and patience (especially when you have collaborators that are new to this approach), this course is just an initial step down that path. I’ll do my best to keep it simple - please let me know if you have questions!"

    "text": "The Example\n\nSetup\nThe University of Exeter has been conducting an ongoing survey to understand the age at which the belief in Santa Claus begins to drop off. A sample of the data is located in your assignment01 folder. Our task is to bring the data into R, conduct some preliminary exploration of the data, and then fit a model to the data to see if age predicts belief in Santa. We’ll start by branching off of the master Quarto doc in our GitHub repo and then work through the steps together.\n\n\nPseudocode\nBefore we get started, let’s sketch out the steps in our analysis using pseudocode. If you take a look at the tasks I’ve outlined above, you might construct your pseudocode like this:\n\n\nCode\nLOAD: all packages that we need for the analysis\nREAD: Data located in isthereasanta.txt\nCHECK: Data structure and values\nCLEAN: Are there odd values?\nPLOT: Age vs Belief\nMODEL: GLM of Age vs. belief\n\n\n\n\nProgramming\nNow that we have the basic steps in place, let’s transform the pseudocode into a repeatable Quarto document that explains what we’re doing, why, and what we found.\n\nLoad the packages\nPart of what makes R so powerful for data analysis is the number of ready-made functions and packages that are designed for all the things. That said, you can’t take advantage of that power if you don’t load them into your session so that their functions become available. In general, it’s best to do that first thing your document so that other folks can see what packages are necessary before you start running analyses. If you pay attention when these packages load, you may see warnings that a function is masked. This happens because two (or more) packages have functions with the same name. We can be explicit about which version we want by using packagename::functionname(). You’ll see that more later this semester.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.4.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\n\nRead the Data\nBased on our pseudocode our first step is the read the data. We can create headings in Quarto using different numbers of # symbols to keep things organized. The code below uses ``` to create the code chunk and then {r} to tell Quarto which environment to use when running it. I’m specifying a filepath because I’m not working within our git repo, this isn’t great practice, but it’s necessary for the webpage to render correctly. We use paste0 to combine the filepath with the file name (isthereasanta.txt) then read in the data using read_table.\n\n\nCode\nfilepath &lt;- \"/Users/mattwilliamson/Google Drive/My Drive/TEACHING/Intro_Spatial_Data_R/Data/2022/assignment01/\"\n#READ\nsanta &lt;- read_table(paste0(filepath, \"isthereasanta.txt\"))\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Data\nNow that we’ve got the data loaded and assigned it to the santa object. It’s always a good idea to take a look and make sure things look the way you expect, check for NAs, and get a basic understanding of the way your data is being represented by R. This process will get more involved once we start working with spatial data, but it’s good to get in the habit now. We’ll start by looking at the first few rows (using head()), then get a sense for the classes of data using str(), and check for any NAs.\n\n\nCode\nhead(santa)\nstr(santa)\nany(is.na(santa))\n\n\nYou’ll notice a few things. First, because we read this in using the read_table function, the result is a tibble. As such, head() returns both the data and the classes. This makes the result of str() largely redundant (note that if santa were a data.frame this would not be true). The combination of any() with is.na() asks whether any of the cells in santa have an NA value. You can see that there are NAs. Most statistical modeling functions in R don’t like NAs so we’ll try to clean those up here. Before we clean them, let’s try to learn what they are. We can use which() to identify the locations of the NAs.\n\n\nCode\nwhich(is.na(santa), arr.ind = TRUE)\n\n\nWe see that all of them are in the age column (our key predictor variable!). We could also have discovered this using summary().\n\n\nCode\nsummary(santa)\n\n\n\n\nClean the data\nDeciding how to clean NAs is an important decision. Many people choose to drop any incomplete records. We can do that with complete.cases() and see that the resulting object now has only 47 rows.\n\n\nCode\nsanta_complete_cases &lt;- santa[complete.cases(santa),]\n\n\nDropping the incomplete cases may seem like a “safe” approach, but what if there is some systematic reason for the data to be incomplete. Maybe older people are less likely to provide their age? If that’s the case, then dropping these cases may bias our dataset and the models that result. In that case, we may decide to “impute” values for the NAs based on some principled approach. We’ll talk more about what it means to take a principled approach to imputation later in this class. For now, let’s just try to strategies: 1 where we assign the mean() value of age and one where we assign the max() value (to reflect our hypothesis that older people may not provide their age). We’ll do this by using the ifelse() function. Note that we can only do this because all of the NAs are in a single column.\n\n\nCode\nsanta_mean &lt;- santa\nsanta_mean$Age &lt;- ifelse(is.na(santa_mean$Age), round(mean(santa_mean$Age, na.rm=TRUE),digits=0), santa_mean$Age)\n\nsanta_max &lt;- santa\nsanta_max$Age &lt;- ifelse(is.na(santa_max$Age), max(santa_max$Age, na.rm=TRUE), santa_max$Age)\n\n\n\n\nPlot the Data\nNow that we have a few clean datasets, let’s just take a quick look to see if our intuition is correct about the relationship between age and belief in santa. The idea isn’t so much to “prove” your hypothesis, but rather to get to know your data better as a means of identifying potential outliers and thinking about the distribution of your data.\n\n\nCode\nplot(Believe ~ Age, data=santa_complete_cases, main=\"Age vs. Belief in Santa (complete cases)\")\n\nplot(Believe ~ Age, data=santa_mean, main=\"Age vs. Belief in Santa (Age at mean)\")\n\nplot(Believe ~ Age, data=santa_max, main=\"Age vs. Belief in Santa (Age at max)\")\n\n\nThese plots highlight two things. First, because Believe is a logical variable, the only possible outcomes are 0 and 1. This means we can’t fit a typical linear regression (we’ll use a logistic regression instead). Also, we notice that our choice of imputation strategy makes a difference! Let’s fit some models and see what kind of difference it makes.\n\n\nFit Some Models\nWe’ll be using a generalized linear model for this analysis. The details will come up later, but for now, let’s keep it simple. The syntax for the glm() function is relatively straightforward. First we specify the model Believe ~ Age, then we tell it what family binomial(link=\"logit\"), then we remind R of the data. We use the binomial family because there are only 2 possible outcomes (TRUE and FALSE).\n\n\nCode\nfit_complete_cases &lt;- glm(Believe ~ Age, family=binomial(link=\"logit\"), data=santa_complete_cases)\nfit_mean &lt;- glm(Believe ~ Age, family=binomial(link=\"logit\"), data=santa_mean)\nfit_max &lt;- glm(Believe ~ Age, family=binomial(link=\"logit\"), data=santa_max)\n\nsummary(fit_complete_cases)$coef\nsummary(fit_mean)$coef\nsummary(fit_max)$coef\n\n\nWe see the older a person is, the less likely they are to believe in Santa! We also see that the choice of how we handle NAs affects the size of the effect, but not the direction. In class, we’ll write a function to simulate some new data based on this model and see if our results are robust to different assumptions.\n\n\n\nRendering the document\nWhen you click the Render button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document."

The assignments rely on these datatasets and are designed to provide “bite-sized” practice to help cement the topics covered in the (generally 2) lectures that each applies. That said, they may take some and I’d encourage you to start on them early so that we have time to work on any questions you have. Moreover, long coding days are the worst so working in bite size chunks can help keep things fun! Finally, working incrementally will also to encourage you to get in the habit of using git to keep track of your progress.\nI’ll be grading these according to:\n\nPlease Resubmit: This indicates that either your code does not run as written (i.e., your quarto document will not compile on my computer), you did not use Git as instructed, and/or that your responses to the questions I posed indicate that you do not quite understand the material as well as I would like. You’ll need to schedule an appointment to talk with me and we’ll work out what you need to do to get credit for the assignment. Although there isn’t a hard deadline for this resubmission, the assignments build on each other so it’s in your best interest to complete the resubmission before the next assignment. Failure to resubmit will result in no credit for the assignment.\nResubmit If You Like: This indicates that all of the code works as written and that you used Git, but that you may have missed some important concepts. You are welcome to resubmit the assignment and address my comments to help polish the final product, but it is not required for you to get credit for the assignment.\nGood To Go: All of your code works, you completed the necessary Git steps, and all of the pieces are there and polished. I may have some minor comments, but I don’t need you to address them for this assignment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTip\n\n\n\nLate Work: There is no such thing as ‘late work’ with these assignments. Life happens, sometimes things take longer to finish than you expect. If you turn it in, I’ll give you feedback.

    "text": "How does geographic analysis fit into your goals for your research? Given our discussion of the aims and limitations of geographic analysis, are there particular issues that you would like to know more about or guard against?\n\nMy research is based almost entirely on geographic analysis, between estimating ecosystem services and studying agricultural change through time in different Idaho locations. One issue I face is that I integrate ecosystem services data collected and estimated at multiple scales into one analysis. I have to be careful I don’t fall into any pitfalls or fallacies when I combine multiple sources of data. In other cases, I have county level data and have to acknowledge the measurement bias that comes with data collection along those policial boundaries.\n\nWhat are the primary components that describe spatial data?\n\nI would say that the primary components are the coordinate reference system (because it helps us understand where we actually are on Earth), the extent of the data (because that helps me know what scale we’re working with and the size of the computational problem), the resolution (same reason as extent), the geometry, and spatial support. I don’t think about this last one often enough, but it really is the key to honest interpretation of the spatial data that you have.\n\nWhat is the coordinate reference system and why is it important\n\nThe CRS consists of the information necessary to locate points in 2 or 3 dimensional space. Coordinates are only meaningful in the context of a CRS (i.e., (2,2) could describe any number of places in the world - we need to know the origin and the datum to actually know where that is). The CRS becomes particularly important when we need to align datasets that were not collected in the same CRS originally or when we need to transfer locations from the globe to a flat surface (e.g., map, screen, etc).\n\nFind two maps of the same area in different projections? How does the projection affect your perception of the data being displayed?\n\nHere’s a fun article on projections that shows what I’m talking about!\n\nRead in the cejst_nw.shp file in the assignment01 folder. How many attributes describe each object? How many unique geometries are there? What is the coordinate reference system?\nI can read in the data using st_read or read_sf\n\nlibrary(sf)\n\ncejst.sf &lt;- read_sf(\"/opt/data/data/assignment01/cejst_nw.shp\")\ncejst.st &lt;- st_read(\"/opt/data/data/assignment01/cejst_nw.shp\")\n\nYou can inspect the differences between the resulting object classes by calling class\n\n```{r}\n#| message: false\n\nclass(cejst.sf)\nclass(cejst.st)\n```\n\n[1] \"sf\"         \"tbl_df\"     \"tbl\"        \"data.frame\"\n[1] \"sf\"         \"data.frame\"\n\n\nYou’ll notice that using st_read assigns the object to an sf and data.frame class meaning that functions defined for those two classes will work. Alternatively, read_sf assigns the object to sf, tbl_df, tbl, and data.frame classes meaning that a much broader set of functions can be run on the cejst.sf object.\nBecause the data are in wide format, we can assume that there is only 1 observation for each location (because sf requires that there is a geometry entry for every observation (even if it’s empty)). Probably the easiest way to get the number of observations is:\n\n```{r}\nnrow(cejst.sf)\n```\n\n[1] 2590\n\n\nSimilarly, if we wanted to know how many attributes are collected for each observation we could use ncol:\n\n```{r}\nncol(cejst.sf)\n```\n\n[1] 124\n\n\nNote that these are really only approximate estimates. There’s usually a lot of extra ID-style columns in spatial data such that the number of columns with useful information is less than the total number of columns, but we won’t worry about that for now."

In that section, you should give me the citation for the article and a brief description (similar to the caption) of the figure.\n\nIn order to do this, you’ll need to start a new Quarto document (File -&gt; New File -&gt; Quarto Document). Once you’ve done that Rstudio will open up a Quarto document with the yaml header already in place and a bunch of example text and code. Delete that. Then use Markdown syntax to specify headings (# for top level headings, ## for second level headings, etc.) So in this case, once you’ve gotten all of the example stuff deleted, you can use # Introduction to create a section header with the correct title. Adding citations requires you to create a separate, .bib file that lives in the same directory as your document and has your citation info in BIBTEX format. You can find more on that here.\n\n2.

    "text": "1. Write out the pseudocode that you would use to set up an analysis of the spatial correlations between chronic asthma risk, exposure to PM2.5, and wildfire. You don’t have to write functions or any actual code. Just write the steps and insert named code blocks for each step.\n\nThis one is probably a little tricky if you haven’t taken the time to check out the attributes of the data (which you should always do). That said, some pretty generic steps would be:\n\n\n1. Load each dataset\n2. Check geometry validity\n3. Align CRS\n4. Run Correlation\n5. Print Results\n\n\nThere are two key steps here, that you’ll repeat for any/all spatial analyses that you do: 1) checking for valid geometries and 2) making sure the data are aligned in a sensible CRS. I can add a code chunk for each now.\n\n\n1. Load each dataset\n\n\n2. Check geometry validity\n\n\n3. Align CRS\n\n\n4. Run Correlation\n\n\n5. Print Results\n\n2. Read in the cdc_nw.shp, pm_nw.shp, and wildfire_hazard_agg.tif files and print the coordinate reference system for each object. Do they match?\n\nHere I’m going to combine the load portion of my pseudocode with the validity since I can do that without creating additional object. I use the str() function to get a sense for what the data looks like and to understand what data classes I’m working with. Then, I use the all() function to make sure that all of the results of st_is_valid() are true. I don’t need to do that with the raster file as the geometry is implicit which means that it has to be topologically valid (this doesn’t mean that the numbers are accurate, it just means that the dataset conforms to the data model R expects). Then I’ll add another code to check the CRS of the different objects.\n\n\nlibrary(sf)\nlibrary(terra)\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n# cdc.nw &lt;- read_sf(\"data/opt/data/2023/assignment03/cdc_nw.shp\")\n# str(cdc.nw)\n# all(st_is_valid(cdc.nw))\n# pm.nw &lt;- read_sf(\"data/opt/data/2023/assignment03/pm_nw.shp\")\n# str(pm.nw)\n# all(st_is_valid(pm.nw))\n# \n# wildfire.haz &lt;- rast(\"data/opt/data/2023/assignment03/wildfire_hazard_agg.tif\")\n# str(wildfire.haz)\n\n\nNow that I’ve gotten the data into my environment, I need to make sure that the CRS are alligned. I’ll demonstrate that with a few different approaches. You can use the logical == or the identical function to check, but remember that these fnctions are not specific to spatial objects, they evaluate things very literally. So even if the CRS is the same, if st_crs returns the CRS in one format (WKT) and crs returns it in another, you’ll get FALSE even if they are actually the same CRS - pay attention to that. You’ll notice that they aren’t identical; we’ll deal with that in the next question.\n\n\n# st_crs(cdc.nw)\n# st_crs(pm.nw)\n# crs(wildfire.haz)\n# \n# identical(st_crs(cdc.nw), st_crs(pm.nw))\n# st_crs(cdc.nw) == st_crs(pm.nw)\n\n3. Re-project the cdc_nw.shp and pm_nw.shp shapefiles so that they have the same CRS as the wildfire_hazard_agg.tfi file. Verify that all the files have the same projection.\n\nNow we’ll use st_transform to get the two shapefiles aligned with the raster (because we generally want to avoid projecting rasters if we can). We can then use the same steps above to see if they’re aligned. Note that I’m using the terra::crs() function to make sure that the output is printed in exactly the same format\n\n\n# cdc.nw.proj &lt;- cdc.nw %&gt;% st_transform(., crs=crs(wildfire.haz))\n# pm.nw.proj &lt;- pm.nw %&gt;% st_transform(., crs=crs(wildfire.haz))\n# \n# identical(crs(cdc.nw.proj), crs(wildfire.haz))\n# identical(crs(pm.nw.proj), crs(wildfire.haz))\n\n4. How does reprojecting change the coordinates of the bounding box for the two shapefiles? Show your code\n\nNow we just want to look at the bounding box of the data before and after it was projected. We can do this using st_bbox. One of the most obvious changes is that the units for cdc.nw have changed from degrees to meters (as evidenced by the much larger numbers). For the pm.nw object we can see that the raw coordinates indicate a shift to the west; however, because the origin for this crs has also changed, the states still show up in the correct place.\n\n\n# st_bbox(cdc.nw)\n# \n# st_bbox(cdc.nw.proj)\n# \n# st_bbox(pm.nw)\n# \n# st_bbox(pm.nw.proj)\n\n5. What class of geometry does the pm_nw.shp have (show your code)? Now filter the pm_nw.shp file so that only the records from Ada County, Idaho are showing. Find the record with the lowest value for PM25. How many coordinates are associated with that geometry?\n\nThis one was probably a little tricky. First, to check the geometry type, we use st_geometry_type setting by_geometry to FALSE means we get the geometry type for the entire object instead of each observation. We then use a series of filter commands to get the records from Idaho and Ada county. Once we’ve narrowed the data to our correct region, we can filter again to find the row with the minimum value of PM25 (note that we have to set na.rm=TRUE so that we ignore the NA values). Then we just take the number of rows (nrow) of the result of st_coordinates to get the number of coordinates associated with that geometry.\n\n\n# st_geometry_type(pm.nw, by_geometry = FALSE)\n# \n# ada.pm &lt;- pm.nw %&gt;% \n#   filter(STATE_NAME==\"Idaho\" & CNTY_NAME==\"Ada\") %&gt;% \n#   filter(PM25 == min(PM25, na.rm = TRUE))\n# \n# ada.pm\n# \n# nrow(st_coordinates(ada.pm))"

Your analysis should incorporate at least 5 datasets. The ultimate compostion of your database is up to you, but I’d like you to include 1 tabular dataset, 1 vector dataset, and 1 raster dataset. You should choose the other 2 (or more) to give you practice with the data types that are most relevant to your objectives and/or research.\nAnalyses. You’ve learned several classes of analyses (e.g., overlays, point-pattern, multivariate regression, and statistical learning). Apply at least one (preferably the one most tied to your own objectives and research) of these analyses to address your question. In the course of doing so, you’ll need to justify your choice, assess whether your data meets appropriate assumptions, and evaluate the implications of key assumptions you make. For example, if you’re conducting an overlay analysis, how does your choice of threshold affect the ultimate result? If you’ve fit a statistical model based on summary statistics (e.g, mean, median), how well does the model fit? How does the model change if you use different slices of the data?\nVisualizations. You should produce a minimum of 3 visualizations to accompany your analysis. One of these should be a publication quality location map. The others are up to you, but should a) help you tell the story of your analysis and b) help you meet your objectives for the course and your own research. These can be additional maps of results, figures that summarize your data or results in non-spatial ways, or interactive graphics that allow you to explore parts of your analysis.\nReporting You can generate a ‘manuscript’ style document (using Quarto) or a flexdashboard (using Quarto and shiny) as the final product. Your report should include:\n\nA brief (1-2 paragraphs) description of your question and why you’re interested in it.\nA Methods section with subsections describing the data sources, any processing steps you took and why, and your process for the analysis. Show your code and provide annotation to describe what you are attempting do with the various steps.\nA Results section that includes tabular results as well as any relevant visualizations that describe your data and analysis.\nA Discussion of your results that puts your results in the context of your question, considers alternative analysis strategies and why they may or may not be better than the approach you chose, describes additional data that might be important for your question, and considers the role of extent and resolution in your analysis.",

I bet you’ll find something interesting.\n Conservation biogeography: assessment and prospects by Whitaker et al. (2005) provides an overview of the of geography in understanding ecosystem function and shaping conservation strategies.\n Economic geography, politics, and policy by Rickard (2020) provides a review of the role of geography in understanding responses to globalization.\n Revolutionary and counter revolutionary theory in geography and the problem of ghetto formation by David Harvey (1972) offers a scathing critique of quantitative geography (though Harvey was one of the founders of the field). See (Barnes 2009) for a relatively recent attempt to reconcile these views.\n Does scale exist? An epistemological scale continuum for complex human–environment systems by Steven Manson (2008) is one of my favorite summaries of the various definitions and confusion surrounding scale as a concept invoked in many disciplines.\n Spatial Scaling in Ecology by John Wiens (1989) describes the fundamental challenges of scale in Ecology.",

Transformations allow you to actually manipulate the geometries of a vector object (without necessarily changing the attributes themselves) and are a powerful tool for geting disparate data into some logical alignment. That said, transforming geometries can be complicated and often has some unanticipated consequences. That’s why we spent a little bit of time learning the mapping syntax as a means for you to be able to check yourself."

In geostatistical analyses, we have observations or a spatial process from a limited sample of locations, but would like to be able to infer the values of that process across the entire study region (or at least an area larger than we initially sampled). Interpolation provides one simple way of doing this that relies on the notion that we can learn something about the process simply from our measurements and the location those measurements were taken. We can extend these approaches by adding additional covariates and model structures, but we’ll start simple for now."

    "text": "Setting Up a Local Repository\nAnother function of Git is to store all your relevant files in a repository, similar to a project. You can create a repository that is located only on your device (therefore it is considered “local”). This will allow you to track changes to a project on your computer and access previous versions of the document at any time. We will look at how to create a local repository using Rstudio, but know that it is also possible to do this using the terminal. (See page 96 of Gandrud (2015))\n\nIn Rstudio, select File in the top left corner, and then New Project\nWhen the New Project menu appears, select New Directory\n\n\nOn the following screen, select New Project\nFinally, type the name you want to use for your new project, browse to the location where you want it saved on your computer, and select the Create a git repository box.\n\n\nYou now have a folder with a .Rproj object and a .gitignore file. There is also a hidden .git folder that stores all the project information, including the version history files (commit history).\n\nAdding, Staging, and Committing\nYou can create new files or move existing files (including your data) into this project folder, and Git can track changes made to them. In order to do this, you will need to “add” files that have been created or moved into the project and “commit” these changes.\nFirst, you will need to save the new file or move an existing file into the project folder. Then, you will “add” those files to your commit by checking the boxes in the Git tab in your Rstudio window. If Git is already tracking a document, you will see an M in the status column, however, if the file hasn’t been added (and is therefore not being tracked), you will see a ? in the status column.\n\nIn order to save a version of your project as it is right now (with these added files), you will need to commit. To do this, select the Commit button, above the boxes you just checked. This will open a new window where you can see the list of files that you added.\nType a useful message in the Commit message box briefly describing the changes you made in this version. Then hit Commit.\n\nYou should see a window pop up telling you what changes were successfully made. If this window ever says “failed”, “execution halted”, or “aborted”, this means the commit did not work and you should read the message closely to determine why.\nSave and commit frequently in order to get the most use out of your version control.",

You can create additional branches which are an exact copy of the main branch where you can make changes without committing them to the master. This is useful when several people are working on the same thing, or if you want to try multiple approaches to the same file (i.e. test run some code).\nTo create a branch, select the button with small purple shapes on the right hand side of your Git tab in Rstudio.\n\nYou can now create a new branch, for example one called “test”. This is essentially a copy of everything that is in your repository, and making changes here will not affect the main branch.\nTo switch between branches, select the drop down menu to the right of the button you used to create a new branch.\n\nYou can easily switch to a different branch by selecting it on this menu.\nNote that any files you create on a side branch will not show up in the main branch unless you merge them.\nYou can have multiple branches coming off your main branch at once, so you can try multiple different approaches (or by multiple people) simultaneously. Anytime you make a new branch it will start as a duplicate of the main branch.\nYou can see a history of your commits on different branches by selecting the clock icon (designating “History”) near the Commit button on your Git tab. You will initially see the history for only the branch you are currently in, but if you select the drop down menu of branches at the top of this window, you can select another branch or all branches and see how the branches compare to one another.\n\n\n\nMerging\nIf you find a method that works in a side branch and you want to bring it in to the main branch, this is called a merge.\nTo merge a side branch with the main branch (changing the version of your repo main branch to match that of the successful side branch), we will use the terminal.\n\nMake sure you are on the main branch\nSelect the Terminal tab next to the Console tab in the section of Rstudio displaying your console.\nType git merge and then the name of the branch you want to merge into the main branch.\n\n\nThe repository of your main branch should now match the repository of whatever branch you merged with it.\nOne way to check if the branches merged the way you intended is to select the history button again (make sure you go to all branches) and check that the “HEAD” (which is the main branch) is at the same level as whichever branch you merged it with.",

    "text": "Setting Up Remote Repositories\nTo set up a remote repository, make sure you are able to log into GitHub. We will go over three different ways to make repositories: starting from scratch with a new repository, creating a repository for an already started project, and accessing a repository made by a collaborator.\n\nNew Repository\nTo create a brand new repository, click on the plus sign near your profile picture in the top right corner of GitHub and select New repository.\n\nOn the next page, type in a name for your repository and choose whether you want it to be public or private. It is recommended you select the box to create a README file. This will give you a place to describe the layout of your repository and the purpose of each file. Without a README file, visitors to your repository (and maybe future you) might not be able to figure out how to properly use the files in your repository, leading to your working being non-reproducible.\n\nNow you can click Create Repository.\nOnce your repository is created, you will see only the README file is present. To create other files, let’s create a directory for this repo on our computer.\n\nIn R studio, follow the instructions for creating a new project, but when you see the following menu, select Version Control this time.\n\n\n\n\nOn the next window, select Git.\nReturn to the GitHub page for the repository you created and select the green Code button.\nCopy the HTTPS link from the menu that pops up.\n\n\n\nReturn to Rstudio and paste the link in the Repository URL line at the top of the popped up window. Make sure to check the file path that is currently set and use the Browse button if you want to save the folder for this directory in a different place.\n\n\nYour repository is now set up in a new project in Rstudio, and you can begin by creating an Rmarkdown, R Script, etc.\nNote, you can edit the contents of the README file by opening it in Rstudio.\n\n\nFrom an Existing Project\nYou may find yourself wanting to create a repo on GitHub for a project you have already started working on. Fortunately, it is easy to start version control tracking on a project and add the project to a remote repository.\nHere are the steps to follow if you have a project folder with a .Rproj file in it and your directory is not already being tracked with Git:\n\nFollow the steps above for creating a New repository, but this time do not click the box to create a README file. This will bring you to a page with a “Quick Set Up” link. Keep this page open for later.\n\n\n\n\nGo to RStudio and open the .Rproj file that will be added to the GitHub repository./\nSelect the Terminal tab next to Console and enter the following lines of code.\n\n\n\nCode\n$ git init -b main\n\n\n“git” tells bash what program we want to use   “init” tells bash to initialize a Git repository fir this directory\n“-b main” is saying we want to create a branch called “main”\n\n\n\nCode\n$ git add .\n\n\nThis will add all of the files within the current folder to the repository. You may get a lot of warnings because you have a .Rproj file and potentially a .Rhistory file in this folder which are not usually ideal to track. We will take care of this by adding these file names to the .gitignore file shortly.\n\n\nCode\n$ git commit -m \"First commit\"\n\n\nThis line creates your first commit. You can change the commit message to anything that makes sense to you.\n\nGo back to GitHub and copy the Quick start link. Type the following code in the terminal, but replace &lt;REMOTE_URL&gt; with the copied link.\n\n\n\nCode\n$ git remote add origin &lt;REMOTE_URL&gt;\n# Replace \"&lt;REMOTE_URL&gt;\" with url from GitHub\n\n\n\nLast, we will push these changes to GitHub. We will further discuss what this means later, but for now run the following line in the terminal.\n\n\n\nCode\n$ git push origin main\n\n\nNow when you return to GitHub and refresh your repository page, you should see all of the files from your existing project.\nYou can add a README and .gitignore on the GitHub website by selecting “Add file” on the repository’s page. When you make a .gitignore file, it may suggest you use a template, in which case, select the R template from the drop down list and it will automatically fill the document with file types that should typically not be tracked.\n\n\nCloning a Repository\nIf you want to join a repository that has already been created, you can either find the repository by searching for it on GitHub (if it is publicly available) or contact the creator and have them add you as a collaborator to the repository. Either way, you will follow steps 1-5 in the “New Repository” section above, but this time the link is coming from the already created repository.\nIn cases where the repository is not accessible (you do not have cloning priveleges), you will have to create a pull request.",

However, now we must take steps to make sure our local version of the repository is up-to-date with the online version, and the versions that all other collaborators have on their computers.\nTo do this, we will need to “push” and “pull”. “Pulling” is when we bring recent and out-of-sync changes from the online version to our local device. “Pushing” is the opposite; we are sending our commits to the online version to update it with our recent changes. This will allow anyone else working in the repository to “pull” your changes onto their computer.\nTo push and pull, use the blue and green arrows on the Git tab in R studio.\n\nYou may also notice the next time you “commit” your changes, these same push and pull buttons are located above the “Commit Message” box on the pop up window.\nIt is good practice to “pull” each time you are about to start working in a repository and to push after you commit, or at least once at the end of your working period within a repository for the day.

Merge conflicts happen because Git is not sure how to combine the different changes that occurred in the same sections of the document. In some instances, Git is smart enough to figure it out and will merge the versions on its own. Other times, the merge conflict will be need to be fixed manually. Note that Git will not allow the push until the merge conflict is solved.\nIf a merge conflict occurs, you will see some specific things added to your code. There will be a line at the beginning that starts with &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;, a line at the end starting with &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; and a line in the middle that just has =======. The two different version are shown above and below the middle line, labeled with which branch has which version. It is your job to decide how these versions fit together. Once you have modified the code to match the final version you want to keep, you can delete the three lines of code containing the &gt;, &lt; and = symbols and “stage” and “commit” your files as usual.\n\n\nOn GitHub\nYou can also merge branches and resolve merge conflicts on GitHub. You would push your branch to GitHub, then go to the GitHub repo webpage. You will need to create a pull request to merge your branch. If there is a merge conflict, you will need to click on “Resolve conflicts” before you can merge your branch. The syntax to edit the document and resolve the conflict is the same as above.",

Many branches are short-lived and deleted once their purpose has been served. Anyone that has access to the repository also has access to the branches in it. A fork creates a copy of the entire repository as well, however, the collaborators are disconnected from it. The intent is generally to diverge from the original repository and never be merged back into it.",

    "text": ".gitignore and Large Files\nGitHub does not allow repositories to be larger than 5GB. While we recommend keeping all of the files necessary to run your analysis together in the repo, this may not be possible if say for example your data files are larger than the size limit. If this is the case, you can manually distribute your data file a different way. (See https://git-lfs.github.com/ first though if this is an issue you are actually having.)\nOnce all collaborators (or just you) have the large data file in your Git repo, you may forget that you cannot send this to GitHub and accidentally try to commit and push it. Fortunately, Git will recognize the problem before it takes place and will give you the following warning:\n\nTo resolve this problem, you just need to tell Git to ignore the large file when you make your commit. First, determine which file(s) is/are too big by looking at their size. Then, navigate to your .gitignore document and open it. Last, add the name(s) of the file(s) that is/are too large. Now you will be able to commit and push the tracked files within your repository.\nYou can add any files you do not want to be tracked to .gitignore. An example is the html file generated by rendering this document. It is regenerated constantly, so there is no need to track the changes.",

    "section": "The Example",
    "text": "The Example\n\nSetup\nThe University of Exeter has been conducting an ongoing survey to understand the age at which the belief in Santa Claus begins to drop off. A sample of the data is located in your assignment01 folder. Our task is to bring the data into R, conduct some preliminary exploration of the data, and then fit a model to the data to see if age predicts belief in Santa. We’ll start by branching off of the master Quarto doc in our GitHub repo and then work through the steps together.\n\n\nPseudocode\nBefore we get started, let’s sketch out the steps in our analysis using pseudocode. If you take a look at the tasks I’ve outlined above, you might construct your pseudocode like this:\n\n\nCode\nLOAD: all packages that we need for the analysis\nREAD: Data located in isthereasanta.txt\nCHECK: Data structure and values\nCLEAN: Are there odd values?\nPLOT: Age vs Belief\nMODEL: GLM of Age vs. belief\n\n\n\n\nProgramming\nNow that we have the basic steps in place, let’s transform the pseudocode into a repeatable Quarto document that explains what we’re doing, why, and what we found.\n\nLoad the packages\nPart of what makes R so powerful for data analysis is the number of ready-made functions and packages that are designed for all the things. That said, you can’t take advantage of that power if you don’t load them into your session so that their functions become available. In general, it’s best to do that first thing your document so that other folks can see what packages are necessary before you start running analyses. If you pay attention when these packages load, you may see warnings that a function is masked. This happens because two (or more) packages have functions with the same name. We can be explicit about which version we want by using packagename::functionname(). You’ll see that more later this semester.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.4.0\n✔ ggplot2   3.5.1     ✔ tibble    3.2.1\n✔ lubridate 1.9.3     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.2     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\n\nRead the Data\nBased on our pseudocode our first step is the read the data. We can create headings in Quarto using different numbers of # symbols to keep things organized. The code below uses ``` to create the code chunk and then {r} to tell Quarto which environment to use when running it. I’m specifying a filepath because I’m not working within our git repo, this isn’t great practice, but it’s necessary for the webpage to render correctly. We use paste0 to combine the filepath with the file name (isthereasanta.txt) then read in the data using read_table.\n\n\nCode\nfilepath &lt;- \"/Users/mattwilliamson/Google Drive/My Drive/TEACHING/Intro_Spatial_Data_R/Data/2022/assignment01/\"\n#READ\nsanta &lt;- read_table(paste0(filepath, \"isthereasanta.txt\"))\n\n\n\n\nCheck out the Data\nNow that we’ve got the data loaded and assigned it to the santa object. It’s always a good idea to take a look and make sure things look the way you expect, check for NAs, and get a basic understanding of the way your data is being represented by R. This process will get more involved once we start working with spatial data, but it’s good to get in the habit now. We’ll start by looking at the first few rows (using head()), then get a sense for the classes of data using str(), and check for any NAs.\n\n\nCode\nhead(santa)\nstr(santa)\nany(is.na(santa))\n\n\nYou’ll notice a few things. First, because we read this in using the read_table function, the result is a tibble. As such, head() returns both the data and the classes. This makes the result of str() largely redundant (note that if santa were a data.frame this would not be true). The combination of any() with is.na() asks whether any of the cells in santa have an NA value. You can see that there are NAs. Most statistical modeling functions in R don’t like NAs so we’ll try to clean those up here. Before we clean them, let’s try to learn what they are. We can use which() to identify the locations of the NAs.\n\n\nCode\nwhich(is.na(santa), arr.ind = TRUE)\n\n\nWe see that all of them are in the age column (our key predictor variable!). We could also have discovered this using summary().\n\n\nCode\nsummary(santa)\n\n\n\n\nClean the data\nDeciding how to clean NAs is an important decision. Many people choose to drop any incomplete records. We can do that with complete.cases() and see that the resulting object now has only 47 rows.\n\n\nCode\nsanta_complete_cases &lt;- santa[complete.cases(santa),]\n\n\nDropping the incomplete cases may seem like a “safe” approach, but what if there is some systematic reason for the data to be incomplete. Maybe older people are less likely to provide their age? If that’s the case, then dropping these cases may bias our dataset and the models that result. In that case, we may decide to “impute” values for the NAs based on some principled approach. We’ll talk more about what it means to take a principled approach to imputation later in this class. For now, let’s just try to strategies: 1 where we assign the mean() value of age and one where we assign the max() value (to reflect our hypothesis that older people may not provide their age). We’ll do this by using the ifelse() function. Note that we can only do this because all of the NAs are in a single column.\n\n\nCode\nsanta_mean &lt;- santa\nsanta_mean$Age &lt;- ifelse(is.na(santa_mean$Age), round(mean(santa_mean$Age, na.rm=TRUE),digits=0), santa_mean$Age)\n\nsanta_max &lt;- santa\nsanta_max$Age &lt;- ifelse(is.na(santa_max$Age), max(santa_max$Age, na.rm=TRUE), santa_max$Age)\n\n\n\n\nPlot the Data\nNow that we have a few clean datasets, let’s just take a quick look to see if our intuition is correct about the relationship between age and belief in santa. The idea isn’t so much to “prove” your hypothesis, but rather to get to know your data better as a means of identifying potential outliers and thinking about the distribution of your data.\n\n\nCode\nplot(Believe ~ Age, data=santa_complete_cases, main=\"Age vs. Belief in Santa (complete cases)\")\n\nplot(Believe ~ Age, data=santa_mean, main=\"Age vs. Belief in Santa (Age at mean)\")\n\nplot(Believe ~ Age, data=santa_max, main=\"Age vs. Belief in Santa (Age at max)\")\n\n\nThese plots highlight two things. First, because Believe is a logical variable, the only possible outcomes are 0 and 1. This means we can’t fit a typical linear regression (we’ll use a logistic regression instead). Also, we notice that our choice of imputation strategy makes a difference! Let’s fit some models and see what kind of difference it makes.\n\n\nFit Some Models\nWe’ll be using a generalized linear model for this analysis. The details will come up later, but for now, let’s keep it simple. The syntax for the glm() function is relatively straightforward. First we specify the model Believe ~ Age, then we tell it what family binomial(link=\"logit\"), then we remind R of the data. We use the binomial family because there are only 2 possible outcomes (TRUE and FALSE).\n\n\nCode\nfit_complete_cases &lt;- glm(Believe ~ Age, family=binomial(link=\"logit\"), data=santa_complete_cases)\nfit_mean &lt;- glm(Believe ~ Age, family=binomial(link=\"logit\"), data=santa_mean)\nfit_max &lt;- glm(Believe ~ Age, family=binomial(link=\"logit\"), data=santa_max)\n\nsummary(fit_complete_cases)$coef\nsummary(fit_mean)$coef\nsummary(fit_max)$coef\n\n\nWe see the older a person is, the less likely they are to believe in Santa! We also see that the choice of how we handle NAs affects the size of the effect, but not the direction. In class, we’ll write a function to simulate some new data based on this model and see if our results are robust to different assumptions.\n\n\n\nRendering the document\nWhen you click the Render button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document.",
