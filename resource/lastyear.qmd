title: "Past years' classes"
---

2021 was the first time this class was taught in its current format. Matt Williamson built a number of worked examples to try to clarify how different parts of a spatial workflow come together. Although the examples may diverge a bit from the examples we do this year, the page does have a number of potentially useful pieces. Check out the [examples](https://isdrfall21.classes.spaseslab.com/example/) to access these.
